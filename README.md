## What is this?

This is a small boilerplate to get started with react and electron.

The project uses:

- React + Typescript - As front-end framework and language.
- Vite + tsc - As dev-server and to bundle the frond-end application.
- Electron + electron-builder - To package the application.

## Getting started

- Clone the repository
- `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `yarn start` - Starts the vite dev server and electron
- `yarn release-linux` - Builds the linux release
- Install the recommended vs-code extensions for linting and formatting.

## Extending releases and settings

Look into the [electron-builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/).
